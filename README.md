# sports-league-schedule

The notebook in this repository contains a model for creating a schedule for a simple sports league. I used this problem to create a schedule for a Pokemon Draft League for a group of YouTubers.

# Problem Definition

Consider a sports style league with the following characteristics:
* There are 16 teams
* There are 10 weeks in the season
* Each team plays 1 match each week
* Each match has a home team and an away team
* Each team has 5 home games and 5 away games throughout the season
* Two teams can only face-off against each other at most once in a season

# Requirements

In order to run the model, you will need the following:
* Python
* The Python Library PuLP: https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/
* Jupyter Notebook

# Model

The notebook in this repository contains the model formulation, along with the corresponding code.
